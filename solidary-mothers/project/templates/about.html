        <h3>🌟 Our Story</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 15px; color: #4A4A4A;">
            Solidary Mothers was created from a very personal place — my own story.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 15px; color: #4A4A4A;">
            My name is Letícia Silva Pereira. I'm an immigrant from Brazil, and I come from a simple family. When I became pregnant, preparing for my baby was not easy. Being far from home, in a new country, with limited resources — what should have been a peaceful time also came with stress and financial uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 15px; color: #4A4A4A;">
            I wished I had more support — a community that truly understood what it feels like to build a new life while preparing to welcome a new life.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 15px; color: #4A4A4A;">
            That experience inspired me to create Solidary Mothers.

        <h3>💚 Our Mission</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 15px; color: #4A4A4A;">
            This platform exists to support mothers who may be going through similar challenges — whether you're an immigrant, a first-time mom, or simply someone who needs a helping hand.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 15px; color: #4A4A4A;">
            Our mission is simple: to remind every mother that she is not alone. There are people who care. There is a community ready to help.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 15px; color: #4A4A4A;">
            Solidary Mothers is more than a project — it's a hand extended in solidarity, love, and support.
